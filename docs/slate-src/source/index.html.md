# Introduction

Welcome to the Laundry API! You can use our API to access information
about the laundry machines in the dorms here at Purdue University.

We have no libraries, but this page does thoroughly document the
format of requests and responses to every endpoint in our API.

This example API documentation page was created with 
[Slate](https://github.com/tripit/slate). Feel free to edit it and
 use it as a base for your own API's documentation.

# Authentication

Authentication is not required to use this API. In fact, it
is not supported either, so you should not send sensitive information
to this API. What happens to it is not specified behavior.
